# Bob-omb Battlefield
Bob-omb Battlefield is a new Stage 5, in which survivors will have to explore a grass hill that smells a bit too much like black powder.

A big thanks to Jace for writing stage guide on Risk of Thunder wiki and creating LocationsOfPrecipitation, without him I would've not bothered with stage creation.

Please send bug reports either by tagging me on Discord in RoR2 Modding server, message me directly @viliger or create a Github issue. Github page with VS, Unity and Wwise project is now available.

## Features

  * Smaller, more claustrophobic stage, while offering the same interactable count. This is offset by low light and visibility.
  * Unique combination of enemies (vultures, lemurians, wisps and golems).
  * Supports both DLC and Vanilla enemy and interactable pools.
